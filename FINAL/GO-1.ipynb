    "Languages outside the C family usually use a distinct type syntax in declarations. Although it's a separate point, the name usually comes first, often followed by a colon. For example, you could have:\n",
    "\n",
    "`x: int\n",
    "p: pointer to int\n",
    "a: array[3] of int`\n",
    "\n",
    "These declarations are clear, if verbose - you just read them left to right. Go takes its cue from here, but in the interests of brevity it drops the colon and removes some of the keywords:\n",
    "\n",
    "`x int\n",
    "p *int\n",
    "a [3]int1`\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no direct correspondence between the look of [3]int and how to use a in an expression. You gain clarity at the cost of a separate syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider functions. Let's transcribe the declaration for main as it would read in Go, although the real main function in Go takes no arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "`func main(argc int, argv []string) int`\n",
    "\n",
    "Superficially that's not much different from C, other than the change from char arrays to strings, but it reads well from left to right:\n",
    "\n",
    "function main takes an int and a slice of strings and returns an int.\n",
    "\n",
    "Drop the parameter names and it's just as clear - they're always first so there's no confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "`func main(int, []string) int`\n",
    "\n",
    "One merit of this left-to-right style is how well it works as the types become more complex. Here's a declaration of a function variable (analogous to a function pointer in C):\n",
    "\n",
    "`f func(func(int,int) int, int) int`\n",
    "\n",
    "Or if f returns a function:\n",
    "\n",
    "`f func(func(int,int) int, int) func(int, int) int`\n",
    "\n",
    "It still reads clearly, from left to right, and it's always obvious which name is being declared - the name comes first.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distinction between type and expression syntax makes it easy to write and invoke closures in Go:\n",
    "\n",
    "`\n",
    "sum := func(a, b int) int { return a+b } (3, 4)\n",

    "Pointers are the exception that proves the rule. Notice that in arrays and slices, for instance, Go's type syntax puts the brackets on the left of the type but the expression syntax puts them on the right of the expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "`var a []int`\n",
    "\n",
    "`x = a[1]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For familiarity, Go's pointers use the * notation from C, but the developers could not bring themselves to make a similar reversal for pointer types. Thus, pointers work as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`var p *int`\n",
    "\n",
    "`x = *p`\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "`var p *int`\n",
    "\n",
    "`x = p*`\n",
    "\n",
    "because that postfix * would conflate with multiplication. The prefix asterisk on both types and expressions complicates things in a number of ways. For instance, although one can write:\n",
    "\n",
    "`[]int(\"hi\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "as a conversion, one must parenthesize the type if it starts with a *:\n",
    "\n",
    "`(*int)(nil)`\n",
    "\n",
    "So, Go's pointer syntax is tied to the familiar C form, but those ties mean that we cannot break completely from using parentheses to disambiguate types and expressions in the grammar. The syntax is however much easier to understand than C's."
