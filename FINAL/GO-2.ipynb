Since the square roots of negative numbers are *complex numbers*, we could limit this function to positive inputs only, returning an error if `x` is less than zero. So, we want to return two values. The first one is the `float64` (we're not doing the calculation so I'll just return zero), and then we can use the new function in the `errors` package (which we have to import) to create an error. Otherwise, we can do the square root. There is actually a square root function in the `math` package, so we can just defer to that. We still do need to return two values though, and in this situation we don't want to return an error, so I'll just return `nil` instead of the error. So now when we call our square root function, we get two values. We get the result and we get an error. If the error is not `nil` (`if err != nil`), then that means something has gone wrong, so we'll just output that, otherwise, we'll output the result. All of this is shown in the code below:"

    "A `struct` is a collection of fields, so you can group things together to create a more logical type. To create a `struct` type, you want to go outisde of the function and use the word `type`, followed by the name (this can be anything you want), followed by the word `struct`. Inside curly brackets `{}` you can list out fields that you want the `struct` to have. Each field needs to have a name and a type. In the example I make it a `string` and an `int`, though it could be literally anything (it could even be another `struct`). So that is the type. To create a `struct` of that type, you want to use the name of it, and then (just like when you initialized an array or slice) you can use curly brackets `{}` to change the fields. In the example below, first I set the field called `name`, then use a colon `:`, and then the value. My example can be seen below:"
